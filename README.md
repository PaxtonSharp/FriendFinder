# FriendFinder - Pokemon Edition!

compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

The questions in this application are meant to try and match you up with 1 of the 5 possible Pokemon to be matched up with. These Pokemon include: Pikachu, Snorlax, Hitmonchamp, Squirtle, and Charmander! 

Have fun! #GottaCatch'EmAll
